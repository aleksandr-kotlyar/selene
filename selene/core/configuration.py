        Parameters:
            **config_as_kwargs:
                options to override in the new config.

                If `name` is among them, and `driver` is not among them,
                and `self._deep_copy_implicitly_driver_with_name` is True,
                then `driver` will be implicitly added to the options to override,
                i.e. `with_(name='firefox')` will be equivalent
                to `with_(name='firefox', driver=...)`.
                The latter gives a readable and concise shortcut
                to spawn more than one browser:

                >>> config = Config(timeout=10.0, base_url='https://autotest.how')
                >>> chrome = config.driver  # chrome is default browser
                >>> firefox_config = config.with_(name='firefox')
                >>> firefox = firefox_config.driver
                >>> edge_config = config.with_(name='edge')
                >>> edge = edge_config.driver


        Returns:
            a new config with overridden options that were specified as arguments.

            All other config options will be shallow-copied
            from the current config.
            Those other options that are of immutable types,
            like `int` – will be also copied by reference,
            i.e. in a truly shallow way.
